Pretty Scouts is a resource for Sailor Moon fans to find all the manga from the anime Sailor Moon.

Tech Stack: React with hooks, data from Jikan public API v4, Express, Node, NodeMailer, Heroku, CSS & HTML and a dabble in Redux

App was created with React in 2021. In 2025, I udpdated the App to use Vite with Yarn to make changes and remove old ads.
