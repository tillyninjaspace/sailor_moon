Pretty Scouts is a resource for Sailor Moon fans to find all the manga from the anime Sailor Moon.

Tech Stack: React with hooks, data from Jikan public API v4, Express, Node, NodeMailer, Heroku, CSS & HTML and a dabble in Redux

App was created with React in 2021. In January 2025, I updated the App to use Vite with Yarn to be able to make changes as some things with React were deprecated in my previous code.
